//== Astra Control
Astra Control is a Kubernetes application data lifecycle management solution that simplifies operations for stateful applications. Easily protect, back up, and migrate Kubernetes workloads, and instantly create working application clones.


=== Features

Astra Control offers critical capabilities for Kubernetes application data lifecycle management:

* Automatically manage persistent storage
* Create application-aware, on-demand snapshots and backups
* Automate policy-driven snapshot and backup operations
* Migrate applications and data from one Kubernetes cluster to another
* Replicate applications to a remote system using NetApp SnapMirror technology (Astra Control Center)
* Clone applications from staging to production
* Visualize application health and protection status
* Work with a web UI or an API to implement your backup and migration workflows

=== Architecture
The architecture of Astra Control enables it to provide advanced data management capabilities that enhance both the functionality and availability of Kubernetes applications, simplifies the management, protection, and movement of containerized workloads across public clouds and on-prem environments, and provides automation capabilities through its REST API and SDK, enabling programmatic access for seamless integration with existing workflows.

Astra Control is built on four complementary components:

* *Astra Control*: Astra Control is the centralized management service for all clusters under management, providing orchestrated workloads for application protection and mobility in the cloud and on-premises.
** Provides combined view of multiple clusters/clouds
** Enables orchestrated workflows: App Mirror / Application Cloning
** Enables centralized bucket management (Azure Blob, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, StorageGRID)
** Eases account management (user configuration, LDAP integration)
** Provides centralized notifications
** Enables resource visualization and selection
** Provides script management - Centralized scripts that can be applied through execution hooks for added application aware operations
* *Astra Connector*: Astra Connector teams with Astra Control to provide a secure connection to each cluster under management, offering local execution of scheduled operations regardless of connection status.
** Enables local execution of scheduled operations regardless of connection status
** Local operations distribute and optimize system resource usage of Astra across clusters
** Local installation enables least privilege access to cluster for improved security
* *Astra Custom Resources*: Custom Resources used on each cluster provide a Kubernetes-native approach to running operations locally, simplifying integration with other Kubernetes-friendly tooling and automation. 
** Provides CSI - dynamic storage provisioning for containerized workloads
** Provides advanced storage management
*** Enables in-flight encryption of data from container to PV
*** Provides SnapMirror Cloud functionality
*** Enables Azure NetApp Files cross-region, cross-zone replication
* *Astra Control Provisioner*: Astra Control Provisioner delivers core CSI provisioning functionality and advanced storage management capabilities for added security and disaster recovery configuration.
** CRs enable direct eco-system tool integration/automation workflows
** Provides lower-level primitives that enable custom workflows

With the most recent software release, Astra Control is Kubernetes-native, enabling new data protection workflows while staying backward-compatible with the existing API and SDK. Kubernetes-native data protection offers significant advantages; by seamlessly integrating with Kubernetes APIs and resources, data protection can become an inherent part of the application lifecycle through an organization's existing CI/CD and/or GitOps tools.

=== Deployment models
Astra Control is available in two deployment models.
